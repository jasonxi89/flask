# Python-Flask Program
2/23/2019 Update:

Finished the Login.html, base.html and index.html with flask_bootstrap. Using csrf and wtforms and flask_wtf to make sure that the user input the right keywords to enter index.html. Also i want to use session["key"] to save a secret key so that i could verify the customer got the index.html from login.html, not just input index.html in the address.

This is a Python - FLask Program. I am tring to make a personal website to generate a txt file with special formate for a software. I will use flask to host it. Although django is more powerful, but i think dont think i will use all the functions. So flask is better for me. 

Used Package:
Pip3 Install Flask
Pip3 Install Flask-WTF
Pip3 Install bootstrap-flask ( not flask-bootstrap cause it is too old )
pip install flask-sqlalchemy
